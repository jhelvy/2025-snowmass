# Phase 1: Early Trade War (2010-2015)

### US a major solar manufacturer and polysilicon producer

- 2012: Obama imposes 24-36% anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels, citing unfair government subsidies.
- China retaliates with tariffs on US polysilicon exports.
- Chinese manufacturers continue scaling, US polysilicon industry contracts.

---

# Phase 2: Circumvention Era (2015-2020)

- China becomes dominant manufacturer, 80%+ of solar supply chain
- Chinese companies increasingly used "transhipment" through Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam to avoid US tariffs
- US looses significant market share.
- Tariffs remain, but effectiveness diminished due to circumvention

# So what do we do about this tension?

# Climate Clubs: A Potential Solution?

<br>

### **The Concept**: Coalitions of willing countries

- Coordinated climate action
- Preferential trade treatment for members
- Burden sharing for global public goods

--

<br>

### **Trade Dimension**:

- Lower tariffs within the club
- Common standards and regulations
- Technology sharing agreements

--

<br>

### **The Challenge**: Balancing cooperation with competition

---

# The Trilemma

<br>

.leftcol[

### **Three Goals**:

1. **Climate Action**: Speed and scale
2. **Economic Competitiveness**: Domestic benefits
3. **Technology Sovereignty**: Strategic autonomy

]

--

.rightcol[

### **Reality**:

Cannot optimize all three simultaneously

### **Policy Question**:

How to sequence and prioritize?

]

---

# Research and Modeling Implications

<br>

### **Current Models Assume**:

- Frictionless technology transfer
- Global learning curves
- Minimal trade barriers

--

<br>

### **New Reality Requires**:

- Political economy constraints
- Fragmented innovation systems
- Trade policy feedbacks

--

<br>

### **Research Priorities**:

- Extending analysis to other clean technologies
- Designing effective climate clubs
- Updating Integrated Assessment Models

---

class: middle, center

# Key Takeaways

---

# Three Main Points

<br>

### **1. Globalization delivered massive cost savings**

$67 billion for solar PV alone (2008-2020)

--

<br>

### **2. Fragmentation will slow progress and increase costs**

20-25% higher prices by 2030 under national scenarios

--

<br>

### **3. Models need updating to reflect new trade realities**

Political economy cannot be ignored

# The question is whether we can design these policies to preserve the global cooperation that made clean technology affordable in the first place.
